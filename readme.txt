What is an escape room?

"An escape room, also known as a "puzzle room" or "escape game", is a physical adventure game in which players solve a series of puzzles and riddles using clues, hints, and strategy to complete the objectives at hand." -Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_room)

Why?

An escape room can be a fun way to allow students to apply their skills. Depending on the design and the complexity, it could require group work. Escape room may also allow students to be more motivated because of the story aspect. They may be curious about finding out how they could finally escape.
